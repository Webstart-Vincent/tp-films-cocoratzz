                    his own royal destiny. But not everyone in the kingdom

                    for Pride Rock is ravaged with betrayal, tragedy and drama,

                    Ever since US Diplomatic Security Service Agent Hobbs and

                    humanity, both join forces to defeat him. (A spin-off of
                    “The Fate of the Furious,” focusing on Johnson's Luke Hobbs
